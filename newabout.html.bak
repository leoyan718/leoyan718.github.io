 <div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">Leo Yan is from the Bay Area and is a 2nd year student of SJSU planning to major in Digital Media Art. He discovered his interest in digital media in high school ever since he enrolled in a Computer Art class during freshman year. In that class, he learned about the basics of digital art including how to use softwares such as Photoshop and iMovie. From then throughout his sophomore to senior years, he participated in the Digital Media Design Academy in his school learning all sorts of new things. He discovered many applications and softwares to make art throughout the years. But he was introduced to Blender during the lockdown pandemic of 2020 and was interested in pursuing that software. He started using Blender to make thumbnails and pose video game models through character rigging. And ever since then and his freshman year of college where he was taught more things he never knew about Blender, he knew it was his favorite software to work in yet.

<div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">My work explores all types of digital media. Most of us spend our lives nowadays staring at a screen due to how technology could be so important and also convenient for our everyday lives. If I could give a rough estimate, I would have to say I spend about a good amount of my time on a computer daily whether it be for school or just entertainment purposes. My designs are inspired by video games and other media mostly since I grew up playing lots and lots of video games. Those ideas from the games I have played inspired me in a way that makes me want to recreate some elements from the games. Some of those elements include the design of character models and the general atmosphere of the environment that impacts the ambiance of many different games. 
<div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">	I find making art in 3D programs such as Blender allows me to do so much more and expand on my creativity. I believe that 3D art is really special compared to others since it allows me to create more detailed and almost realistic art that my audience could look at. Some important factors in which I believe makes 3D art special is the customization of lighting, texture, and models in a scene. I always use these three main factors in each of my works in order to display a scene that looks realistic and gives off really good feelings.
<div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">	With that being said, most of my work in my portfolio is focused on 3D environments made in Blender. The main reason why I prefer to focus my pieces on environments is because I wanted to make imaginary places where I would see myself being in it and hopefully the viewer would have the same experience as well when looking at my renders. A lot can be described in a room when said, but it is so much better to visually see all the details and actually feel like you are in that room when looking at the pieces. In my pieces I also like to make different versions of them in order for more of a variety. Those different versions of my work are not only slightly different, but they also give off a completely different feeling. Itâ€™s like rearranging your bedroom for the first time in a while. Your bedroom would suddenly feel like a completely different room that you are unfamiliar with even though you are still in the same room.
<div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">Furthermore, I am always looking for ways to improve my work and expand on my creative skill sets.The goal with my work is to bring all the ideas I have gathered from my experience as a longtime gamer and implement those ideas into my own personal creations.
