<br>
 <div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">Leo Yan is from the Bay Area and is an upcoming 4th year student of SJSU planning to major in Digital Media Art. He discovered his interest in digital media in high school ever since he enrolled in a Computer Art class during freshman year. In that class, he learned about the basics of digital art including how to use softwares such as Photoshop and iMovie. From then throughout his sophomore to senior years, he participated in the Digital Media Design Academy in his school learning all sorts of new things. He discovered many applications and softwares to make art throughout the years. But he was introduced to Blender during the lockdown pandemic of 2020 and was interested in pursuing that software. He started using Blender to make thumbnails and pose video game models through character rigging. And ever since then and his freshman year of college where he learned more about Blender, he knew it was his favorite software to work in yet.

<div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">Leo Yan is an artist based in the Bay Area that works primarily in the digital 3D field to make environments, bringing his personal and unique ideas to life. He is mainly inspired by the video games he used to play when he was younger due to the immersive worlds and designs they offered. Ever since then, he wanted to pursue similar creations and inspire many others through his work too. In his work, he creates environments and spaces that evoke similar feelings that he experienced when playing video games as a kid. Using Blender as his primary tool, besides making something just visually appealing, he strives to create pieces that carry a personal significance for him. The majority of his pieces reflect memories, emotions, and experiences he had encountered throughout his life and artistic journey.
