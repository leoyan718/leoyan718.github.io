<p style="font-family:lucida grande,monospace;color:white;text-align:center;">A collaborative piece made with my peer, Ashlyn Larrus, who is a 2D digital artist. 2D and 3D incorporation we did of a room comparing and contrasting how 3D differs from 2D.</p>
<p style="font-family:lucida grande,monospace;color:white;text-align:center;"> For this project, we wanted to express feelings of calmness, relaxation, and chill vibes by fitting it all in a single room.</p>

<div class="mx-5 fs-5 text-white text-center">For our collaboration project, my partner Ashlyn and I decided to work with 2 different
mediums. Since we are both in the DMA major we really wanted to use our strengths for this
project as her preferred medium to work with is digital 2d drawing in ProCreate while mine is
3D modeling and rendering in Blender. Our goal with this project was to make a room where we
both envision ourselves in to get feelings of calmness, peacefulness, and relaxing feelings. It is a
way for us to obtain these feelings in order to destress for finals because it is around the end of
the semester and they are coming up. So at the end, the outcome would be the same room created
with two different mediums in order to create different visual appeals and also mimicking
different feelings while looking at the two.
To make our room special, we decided to add objects and decorations that contained
sentimental or personal meaning to both of us. Some things we incorporated included a variety of
posters of our favorite albums for destressing. Music is a big part of both our lives since most of
the time, as busy college students who are stressed on a daily basis, we usually spend time
resting while listening to music. Another detail that we added was the sketchbook and pencil on
the floor in the middle of the room. This was to symbolize that another thing that we do when we
are stressed is to draw and brainstorm usually on our sketchbooks. We both do this as a way to
escape our daily pressures and allow ourselves to get a break from everything stressing us out.
The collaboration went pretty well since we kept on updating each other's progress. So
for example, if she finished or made updates to anything, she would notify me as I would do the
same and notify her of my progress or ask any questions I might have. We started this project by
having Ashlyn do the sketches to get a visual idea of how the room layout would look like
including what types of objects go into the room that fit our concept. After we had a clear sketch
of the room layout, she sent it to me and I began working on doing the same in Blender.
Overall, I found this collaboration pretty successful because we both played with our
strengths and did the best we can to render the exact environment. Some difficulties were that I
spent a lot of time focused on modeling one specific object that I didnâ€™t have time to do some
others. It was overall very modeling intensive for me. Although it was my first time
collaborating with another artist and an artist that is also working with a different medium than I
am, I can say that I learned a lot from her medium as well as her process. Hopefully, she could
say the same too because I felt like this project made me more comfortable with working with
another artist rather than just being a solo artist.
